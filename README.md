# Reproducibility Code for  
**"Fast Approximation of Shapley Values through Fractional Factorial Designs"**

This project contains all the code and data needed to reproduce the numerical experiments in the paper  
**"Fast Approximation of Shapley Values through Fractional Factorial Designs"**.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Includes all datasets required to run the experiments.
  - All datasets are publicly available and sourced from:
    - [Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic)
    - [Communities and Crime Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/183/communities+and+crime)
    - [Market Dataset (Entropy 2021)](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/23/12/1598)
- `results/`: Stores the `.RData` output files generated by each script.
- `figures/`: Contains all figures generated from the simulations and examples.
- `shapley_functions.R` includes the core functions required for the numerical experiments.

## How to Reproduce Key Results

The following scripts reproduce specific results and figures in the paper:

- `Figure 1.R`: Reproduces **Figure 1**  
- `Figure 8.R`: Reproduces **Figure 8** 
- `simulation_1_wvg.R`: Reproduces results and figures for **Example 3** (The Weighted Voting Game)
- `simulation_2_airport.R`: Reproduces results and figures for **Example 4** (The Airport Game)
- `simulation_3_wdbc.R`: Reproduces results and figures for **Example 2** (The Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer dataset)
- `simulation_4_crime.R`: Reproduces results and figures for **Example 6** (The Communities and Crime dataset)
- `simulation_5_market.R`: Reproduces results and figures for **Example 5** (The Market game from the Entropy paper)

## Output Format

All output files are saved in the `results/` folder as `.RData` files.  
Each file is named `xx.RData`, where `xx` corresponds to the name of the script that generated it.

All figures produced by the experiments are saved in the `figures/` folder.

## Dependencies

This project requires R (version ≥ 4.3.1) and the following packages:

- `dplyr`
- `ggformula`
- `ggplot2`
- `here`
- `lhs`
